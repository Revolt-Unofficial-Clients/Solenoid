# The Solenoid Contribution Guide

1. Make your fork, don't push directly.
  - You need to make a fork of Solenoid before changing the code. This is important as it helps with code review.
2. Check code linting issues beforehand.
  - We do have a gh-action that does that for us. But it's better when you do it for it.
3. Remember to add some comments.
  - This helps code reviewing and understanding the code. Sometimes the code can be unreadable and trying to parse in my brain what is going on without context is hard.
4. Mention Issues if that PR Closes it.
  - This helps issue management because github.com closes issues if a PR or a commit contains "Closes #<insert_issue_number_here>"
