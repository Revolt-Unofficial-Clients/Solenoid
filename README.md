### Reasons to use it

1. Fast
2. Minimal
3. idk i ran out of reasons

### How 2 run
Right now you can run it using `pnpm`

```bash
# Install Deps
pnpm i --shamefully-hoist
# Run Solenoid from localhost:3000
pnpm run dev
```

Or you can go to [the official site](https://solenoid.vercel.app)

### Features

- [x] Send Messages
- [x] Get Messages
- [x] Server Switching
- [x] Status Updating
- [x] Css Support (No css by default, use a extension to override)

### Why
I wanted to learn SolidJS because I heard it was blazingly fast and cool, so I decided to make a revolt.chat client to challenge my brain (and my sanity).
