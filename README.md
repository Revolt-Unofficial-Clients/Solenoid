A minimal, yet functional third-party revolt.chat client

### Reasons to use it

1. Fast
2. Clean Looking
3. Full of useful features

### How 2 run
Right now you can run it using `pnpm`

```bash
# Clone Repo
git clone https://github.com/stationarystation/Solenoid.git

# Go to repo
cd Solenoid

# Install Deps
pnpm i --shamefully-hoist

# Run Solenoid from localhost:3000.
pnpm run dev

```

Or you can go to [the official site](https://new.solenoid.vercel.app


### Why
I wanted to learn SolidJS because I heard it was blazingly fast and cool, so I decided to make a revolt.chat client to challenge my brain (and my sanity).
