## Reasons to use it
None, unless for some reason the main client is having issues because
this client lacks proper error handling **B**)

instructions on how to setup the client to work locally.

## Motivation
I wanted to learn SolidJS because I heard it was blazingly fast and cool, so I decided to make a revolt.chat client to challenge my brain (and my sanity).
